Installing the Inkscape extension

Place the file cookie-cutter-sweeper.inx and the folder cookie-cutter-sweeper in your Inkscape extensions folder, which can be found at

  ~/.config/inkscape/extensions

on Mac OS X and Linux (on Mac OS X, use "Go > Go to Folder" in the Finder and paste this) and at

  %APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions

on Windows (paste this into the address line of an Explorer window).

After restarting Inkscape, the extension appears under "Extensions > Export > 3D-Printable Cookie Cutter".


Command line usage

For more options, find the "sweep" binary for your platform in the subfolders of cookie-cutter-sweeper and run it on the command line. Running without arguments outputs a usage description.
